"""Release script for production containers (distroless-compatible, no shell needed).

Runs database migrations and clears the Redis cache as part of the deployment process.

Pre-apply, the script logs the migration plan via ``migrate --plan`` so the
operator can grep the deploy log to see exactly which migrations a release is
about to apply. The plan is informational only. It does not gate the deploy;
if a destructive migration is unexpected, the operator must catch it in the
log review.

Concurrency
-----------
The whole migrate step is wrapped in a PostgreSQL *session-level advisory lock*.
Django does not serialise ``migrate`` itself, and two concurrent runners racing
the same migration deadlock or double-apply. That is not hypothetical under
Kubernetes: a Job is "at least once", so a node partition or an evicted pod can
leave two migration pods running at the same moment. The lock makes the second
one wait for the first instead of corrupting the schema.

The lock is advisory and session-scoped: it is released explicitly below, and by
the database automatically if the connection dies, so a killed pod cannot wedge
future deploys.
