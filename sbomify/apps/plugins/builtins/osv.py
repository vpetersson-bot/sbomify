"""OSV vulnerability scanning plugin.

This plugin wraps the OSV scanner binary to scan SBOMs for known
vulnerabilities using the OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) database.

It supports both CycloneDX and SPDX SBOM formats. The scanner binary
requires files with the correct suffix (.cdx.json or .spdx.json) for
format detection, so the plugin creates a correctly-suffixed temporary
copy when needed.

    a Go panic puts its message on line one and then ten kilobytes of goroutine
