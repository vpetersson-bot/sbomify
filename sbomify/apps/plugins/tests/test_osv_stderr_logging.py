"""The reason a scan failed was being dropped from the line reporting it.

The log pipeline splits records on newlines, so a multi-line stderr arrives as
one line per line and only the first stays attached to the message naming it.
osv-scanner opens with a progress line, so every failed scan in staging came
through as:

    [OSV] Scanner returned code 127: Starting filesystem walk for root: /

The exit code survived. The reason for it did not — and a filesystem-walk
progress note is actively misleading about what went wrong, since it reads
like the scanner was told to scan the root directory.
