    """billing:trial_expired must fire exactly once per team, even on redelivered webhooks.

    Stripe can deliver multiple ``customer.subscription.updated`` events that
    still report ``status=trialing`` after we have already downgraded a team
    locally; we rely on a persistent marker in ``billing_plan_limits`` so the
    transition-only side effects do not run twice.

    Uses ``transaction=True`` because ``handle_trial_period`` defers the
    PostHog capture via ``transaction.on_commit`` and those callbacks only
    fire on a real commit (not on rollback at end of a non-transactional
    test).
