"""Tests for the advisory lock in bin/release.py.

The lock is what stops two concurrent deploys from applying migrations at the
same time. Kubernetes Jobs are "at least once", so a node partition really can
leave two migration pods running, and Django does not serialise `migrate`
itself. These tests pin the behaviour the chart depends on.
