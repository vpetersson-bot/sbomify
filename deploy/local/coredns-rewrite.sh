# the Keycloak issuer URL resolve identically on both sides, without it, OIDC
# discovery hands the browser and the application pods different endpoints.

# Shared by bin/kind-up.sh and .github/workflows/helm.yml. It lives in one file
# because it did not used to: the workflow carried its own copy of the Corefile
# with the `health` and `forward` blocks collapsed onto single lines, which
# CoreDNS rejects ("Wrong argument count or unexpected line ending after '}'"),
# so its pods crash-looped and every CI run failed on the rollout timeout.
